# Predicting Personal Loan Approval Using Machine Learning

**INTRODUCTION:**

**Overview**:

The lending industry plays a crucial role in supporting individuals and businesses by providing access to financial resources through various types of loans. One of the most common types is a personal loan, which offers individuals the flexibility to use the funds for various purposes, such as home repairs, medical expenses, debt consolidation, and more.

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent and automated loan approval system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a borrower's financial data and credit history, the system will predict the likelihood of loan approval, assisting financial institutions in making informed decisions quickly and accurately. These systems can analyze vast amounts of historical data and uncover hidden patterns to make data-driven decisions.

**1. Collecting the Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. 

**2. Data Cleaning:**
The first step is to clean the dataset, which includes the following processes:
1.	Handling Missing Values 
2.	Dealing with Duplicate Records

**3. Feature Engineering:**
In this project, we engineer features such as:
1.	Debt-to-Income Ratio
2.	Loan-to-Income Ratio

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
During EDA, various statistical measures and visualizations are used to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between features, and potential correlations between features and loan approval status.

**5. Model Building**
three popular machine learning algorithms are selected for training:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Decision Trees
3.	Random Forests
