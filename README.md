# Predicting Personal Loan Approval Using Machine Learning
#1. Introduction
#1.1 Overview:
The lending industry plays a crucial role in supporting individuals and businesses by providing access to financial resources through various types of loans. One of the most common types is a personal loan, which offers individuals the flexibility to use the funds for various purposes, such as home repairs, medical expenses, debt consolidation, and more.
The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent and automated loan approval system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a borrower's financial data and credit history, the system will predict the likelihood of loan approval, assisting financial institutions in making informed decisions quickly and accurately. These systems can analyze vast amounts of historical data and uncover hidden patterns to make data-driven decisions.
